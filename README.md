Apologies if I should have posted this in career advice.

I'm moving from America(NYC) from Ireland in May to start a 12 month graduate visa programme. I finished university in May 2017 after completing a 3 year social science degree and 1 year computer science diploma from the same university. This was essentially the first 1.5-2 years of a 4 year CS degree in 1 year. The university would be well regarded globally. 

Since September of 2017 I've worked as a front end developer at a government organisation and will continue to work here up until May before the move. I have learned a ton in that time and while I don't know/understand everything I am very confident in my ability to be able to learn anything I encounter. 

I have built 2 websites on a freelance basis since December and have really gotten addicted to learning on my own outside this full time job. 

When I get to the states, I will be looking for primarily an internship or ideally a junior position on the front end initially (would like to work towards full stack). I just have a few questions / concerns:

* 
* Will not having completed a 4 year CS degree really hold me back? 
* Is there anything extra I should be learning in order to get an edge (Here is my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrencarlin/)
* Should I apply to every job even if I don't have the full requirements (i.e 4 year CS degree)
